# Cookiecutter Data Engineering
A logical, flexible, and reasonably standardized project structure for doing data engineering and datascience development. Please feel free to write to me incase of any queries gmail@udayakumar.co.in or hellouday@udayakumar.co.in

Setting up a well-structured project for a data engineering endeavor involving technologies like Python, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Amazon S3, Dell ECS, MySQL, MongoDB, Apache Airflow, and Apache Kafka involves several considerations to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. Hereâ€™s a recommended project structure:

# 1. Overall Structure
    README.md: Project overview, setup instructions, dependencies, and basic usage.
    LICENSE: License information for the project.
    
# 2. Codebase Organization
    src/: Source code directory.
    etl/: Contains ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts.
    processing/: Scripts for data processing using Spark or Flink.
    ingestion/: Scripts for data ingestion from various sources (Kafka, databases, etc.).
    utils/: Utility functions and helper scripts.
    tests/: Unit tests for your scripts.
# 3. Configuration Management
    config/: Configuration files.
    airflow/: Airflow DAG definitions.
    spark/: Spark configuration files.
    flink/: Flink configuration files.
    database/: MySQL and MongoDB connection configurations.
    kafka/: Kafka producer and consumer configurations.
    aws/: AWS S3 credentials and configuration.
    
#4. Data Storage
    data/: Directory for storing raw and processed data.
    raw/: Raw data files.
    processed/: Processed data files.
    archive/: Archived data.
    schema/: Data schema definitions.
    
# 5. Dependency Management
    requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the project.
    environment.yml: Conda environment specification (if using Conda).
    
# 6. Documentation and Logs
    docs/: Project documentation.
    logs/: Log files generated by the ETL and processing jobs.
    
# 7. Deployment and Orchestration
    docker/: Docker configuration files for containerization (optional).
    scripts/: Deployment and orchestration scripts.
    deploy.sh: Script for deploying the project.
    start.sh, stop.sh: Scripts for starting and stopping services.
    
# 8. Version Control
    .gitignore: Specifies files to ignore in version control.
    .git/: Git repository for version control.
    
## Notes:
### Modular Design: Each component (ETL, processing, ingestion) should be modular and independently testable.

### Configuration Management: Centralize all configuration files to maintain consistency across environments.

### Documentation: Include comprehensive README.md and inline documentation to facilitate understanding and maintenance.

### Testing: Implement unit tests in the tests/ directory to ensure the reliability of your code.

### Logging: Configure logging appropriately to track errors and monitor job execution.

### Security: Handle credentials and sensitive information securely, using environment variables or secure vaults.

This structure provides a foundation for developing, testing, and deploying data engineering projects using a variety of technologies, ensuring flexibility and scalability as your project grows. Adjust and expand as necessary based on specific project requirements and team preferences.
